# Report card time for New Orleans

This is a custom-made map of every public school in New Orleans and their grades over the years. A schools are blue, B is green, C is yellow, D is purple, and F is red. I created the map using Google Fusion Tables using data found on <a href="http://thelensnola.org/2017/11/07/see-the-2017-school-performance-scores-all-in-one-place/">The Lens</a>, which in turn got their data from the Louisiana Department of Education.
